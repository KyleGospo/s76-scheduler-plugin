# System76 Scheduler - GNOME Shell Plugin
This is a standalone extension that integrates `system76-scheduler` without
needing `pop-shell` installed.

You should also install `system76-scheduler` separately. I maintain a COPR
for Fedora and derivatives [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mjakeman/system76-scheduler/).

The majority of code in this plugin comes from `pop-shell` and is used under
the `GPL-3.0` licence.
